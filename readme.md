# Euan's Way-Too-Long Collision Detection Thing

Hello everyone, welcome to my TEDTalk. This was supposed to be a quick explainer on basic collision detection of AABBs and Circles, but it kind of ballooned out into a mini-course. I hope it's useful cuz it took way longer than I expected.

GitHub doesn't like these pages when they're too long so unfortunately I've had to split these up. So here's the shit you click on..

[AABB vs AABB Tests](1.md)


[Circle vs AABB Tests](2.md)


[Moving Circle vs AABB](3.md)

- [Collision Ordering](3-1.md)


[Minkowski Shennanigans](4.md)

- [Minkowski Examples](4-1.md)


[Swept Circle vs AABB Test](5.md)
